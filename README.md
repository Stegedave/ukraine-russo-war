# Ukraine Russo War Data Visualization

This project visualizes high-fatality events (20 or more fatalities) during the Ukraine-Russia conflict from 2022 to 2025. The goal is to create both **interactive** and **static** visualizations that show the types of attacks and their geographical distribution, helping to understand the patterns of conflict events over time.

## Features

- **Interactive Maps**: Visualizing high-fatality events on interactive maps, grouped by year. The maps use **time-based animations** to showcase the evolution of the conflict.
  
- **Attack Type Charts**: Displaying bar charts that show the most common types of attacks that lead to mass casualties, broken down by year.

- **Dark Theme**: Both the maps and the bar charts are styled with a dark theme to enhance visual clarity.
